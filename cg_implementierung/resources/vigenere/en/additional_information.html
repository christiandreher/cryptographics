<p><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The idea behind the <span
class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span> cipher, like all polyalphabetic ciphers, is to
disguise plaintext letter frequencies, which interferes with a straightforward
application of frequency analysis. For instance, if P is the most frequent
letter in a <span class=SpellE>ciphertext</span> whose plaintext is in English,
one might suspect that P corresponds to E, because E is the most frequently
used letter in English. However, using the <span class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span>
cipher, E can be enciphered as different <span class=SpellE>ciphertext</span>
letters at different points in the message, thus defeating simple frequency
analysis. The primary weakness of the <span class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span>
cipher is the repeating nature of its key. If a cryptanalyst correctly guesses
the key's length, then the cipher text can be treated as interwoven Caesar
ciphers, which individually are easily broken. The <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span>
and Friedman tests can help determine the key length. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kasiski examination<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>For more details on this topic, see <span
class=SpellE>Kasiski</span> examination. In 1863 Friedrich <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span>
was the first to publish a successful general attack on the <span class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span>
cipher. Earlier attacks relied on knowledge of the plaintext, or use of a
recognizable word as a key. <span class=SpellE>Kasiski's</span> method had no
such dependencies. <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span> was the first to publish
an account of the attack, but it is clear that there were others who were aware
of it. In 1854, Charles Babbage was goaded into breaking the <span
class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span> cipher when John Hall Brock <span class=SpellE>Thwaites</span>
submitted a &quot;new&quot; cipher to the Journal of the Society of the Arts.
When Babbage showed that <span class=SpellE>Thwaites</span>' cipher was
essentially just another recreation of the <span class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span>
cipher, <span class=SpellE>Thwaites</span> challenged Babbage to break his
cipher encoded twice, with keys of different length. Babbage succeeded in
decrypting a sample, which turned out to be the poem &quot;The Vision of
Sin&quot;, by Alfred Tennyson, encrypted according to the keyword
&quot;Emily&quot;, the first name of Tennyson's wife. Babbage never explained
the method he used. Studies of Babbage's notes reveal that he had used the
method later published by <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span>, and suggest that
he had been using the method as early as 1846. The <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span>
examination, also called the <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span> test, takes
advantage of the fact that repeated words may, by chance, sometimes be
encrypted using the same key letters, leading to repeated groups in the <span
class=SpellE>ciphertext</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>There is an easily seen repetition in the <span
class=SpellE>ciphertext</span>, and the <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span> test
will be effective. Here the distance between the repetitions of CSASTP is 16.
Assuming that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, this
implies that the key is 16, 8, 4, 2, or 1 characters long. (All factors of the
distance are possible key lengths a key of length one is just a simple <span
class=SpellE>caesar</span> cipher, where cryptanalysis is much easier.) Since
key lengths 2 and 1 are unrealistically short, one only needs to try lengths
16, 8, or 4. Longer messages make the test more accurate because they usually
contain more repeated <span class=SpellE>ciphertext</span> segments. The
following <span class=SpellE>ciphertext</span> has two segments that are
repeated: <span class=SpellE>Ciphertext</span>:
VHVSSPQUCEMRVBVBBBVHVSURQGIBDUGRNICJQUCERVUAXSSR <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The distance between the repetitions of VHVS is 18.
Assuming that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, this
implies that the key is 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. The distance
between the repetitions of QUCE is 30 characters. This means that the key
length could be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. By taking the
intersection of these sets one could safely conclude that the most likely key
length is 6, since 3, 2, and 1 are unrealistically short. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Once the length of the key is known, the <span
class=SpellE>ciphertext</span> can be rewritten into that many columns, with each
column corresponding to a single letter of the key. Each column consists of
plaintext that has been encrypted by a single Caesar cipher; the Caesar key
(shift) is just the letter of the <span class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span> key that
was used for that column. Using methods similar to those used to break the
Caesar cipher, the letters in the <span class=SpellE>ciphertext</span> can be
discovered. An improvement to the <span class=SpellE>Kasiski</span>
examination, known as <span class=SpellE>Kerckhoffs</span>' method, matches
each column's letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies to discover
the key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is
known, the cryptanalyst can simply decrypt the <span class=SpellE>ciphertext</span>
and reveal the plaintext. <span class=SpellE>Kerckhoffs</span>' method is not
applicable when the <span class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span> table has been
scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, although <span
class=SpellE>Kasiski</span> examination and coincidence tests can still be used
to determine key length in that case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Key elimination<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The <span class=SpellE>Vigen√®re</span> cipher
function is essentially modulo arithmetic, and thus commutative. So if the key
length is known (or guessed) then subtracting the cipher text from itself,
offset by the key length will produce the cipher text encrypted with itself. If
any words in the cipher text are known or can be guessed, then the plain text
and also the key, will be revealed. This is useful if the key is an obscure
sequence of letters because the plain text will generally be ordinary words.
Key elimination is useful for making short versions of the plain text.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
